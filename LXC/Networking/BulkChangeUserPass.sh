# BulkChangeUserPass.sh
#
# This script changes a specified userâ€™s password in a range of LXC containers.
# It uses 'pct exec' to run 'chpasswd' inside each container.
#
# Usage:
#   ./BulkChangeUserPass.sh <start_ct_id> <num_cts> <username> <new_password>
#
# Example:
#   ./BulkChangeUserPass.sh 400 3 root MyNewPass123
#   This updates the root password on CTs 400..402 to 'MyNewPass123'.
#
# Note:
#   - The container(s) must be running for 'pct exec' to succeed.
#   - Adjust logic if you want to handle containers that are stopped.
