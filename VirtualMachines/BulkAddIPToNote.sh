# UpdateVMNotesWithIP.sh
#
# This script retrieves the IP address of each QEMU virtual machine (VM) in the Proxmox VE cluster
# and updates or appends this information to the notes field of the respective VM.
# If the VM does not have Cloud-Init or Qemu Guest Agent returning an IP, it will attempt
# to scan the network for the IP based on the MAC address.
#
# Additionally, if the notes field already has "IP Address: ...", that line will be updated
# with the new IP, rather than adding a duplicate line.
#
# Requires apt install arp-scan to find mac without Cloud-Init drives active
#
# Usage:
#   ./UpdateVMNotesWithIP.sh
